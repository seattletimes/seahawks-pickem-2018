    "condottacommentary": "Seattle's always had problems with the Rams during the Russell Wilson era even in the best of times. These are hardly those, as the Rams look like one of the two best teams in the NFL while Seattle appears a middle-of-the-road club that now has to venture through the rest of the season without one of its two best defensive players. Seattle couldn't have picked a worse matchup to begin the post-Earl Thomas era.",

    "vorelcommentary": "So here’s the deal: Rams quarterback Jared Goff earned a perfect passer rating last week, throwing for 465 yards with five touchdowns and zero interceptions. Running back Todd Gurley II has the second-most rushing yards and rushing touchdowns in the NFL. Three Rams receivers are averaging at least 80 receiving yards per game. Now add that to the fact that the Seahawks’ defense is down both Earl Thomas and Mychal Kendricks. The Seahawks aren’t winning this one.",

    "stonecommentary": "The last time the Rams came to town, the Seahawks were on the bad end of a 42-7 debacle. It won’t be so lopsided this time, but L.A. simply has too many weapons on both sides of the ball. In fact, the balance of power in the NFC West has officially swung from Seattle to Los Angeles, and this game will provide further proof.",

    "calkinsscore": "35-14 Rams",
    "calkinscommentary": "Motivated by the loss of Earl Thomas and the entire sports world doubting them, the Seahawks will rally behind an epic defensive performance and a spectacular 2-minute drill at the end of the game. Kidding.",
