    "condottacommentary": "The Seahawks are in true desperation mode as they play their home opener. Dallas' defense is statistically one of the best in the NFL through two games so there could be some ugly moments for the offense. But the thought here is that Seattle can win this game with defense (Dallas' passing attack has been anemic so far) and special teams (maybe a Michael Dickson punt or two that flips the field) and keep hope alive for another week.",

    "vorelscore": "21-20 Seahawks",
    "vorelcommentary": "Bobby Wagner is back and the Seahawks are finally returning to CenturyLink Field. But is that enough for Seattle to secure its first victory of the season? I think the defense will gain some confidence against a one-dimensional Cowboys attack with a very limited passing game, and Russell Wilson will respond after stumbling in the loss at Chicago last week. Dallas' defense is formidable, but the Seahawks will do just enough to win the game.",

    "stonecommentary": "The Seahawks return home, they get Bobby Wagner and others back off injury, and they will – or at least should – play with the urgency of knowing their season is essentially on the line. Put it together, and it adds up to a vital victory.",

    "calkinsscore": "13-10 Seahawks",
    "calkinscommentary": "Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright returning would provide a much-needed boost for Seattle's defense, but this team just hasn't showed enough offensively through two games to convince me they can win. Expect Dallas to come out on top in a close one.",

    "celebscore": "24-21 Seahawks",
    "celebcommentary": "It’s going to be a battle between two of the more mobile QBs in the league. Let’s hope our D-line can find some momentum and be quick to put the pressure on Dak Prescott to force some early turnovers.",
